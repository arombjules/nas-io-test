**Status:** Active

For this technical exam, we pull in google sheets data via Fivetran. However, the ideal state for nas.io product telemetry should be directly
coming from the backend coordinated from the product team. The tables that we bring in via these google sheets directly 
reflect the google sheet's columns.
